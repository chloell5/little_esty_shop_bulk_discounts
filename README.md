Overview

Bulk Discounts is an extension of a previous project with a four person team. The project was a mock platform for merchants and administrators to manage invoices, items, and transactions. The framework was to be built by the team, while the extension here is a solo project. Solo objectives included consuming a Holiday API, tracking discounts with quantity thresholds and total revenue with or without the discounts. There is full CRUD functionality for the discounts.
